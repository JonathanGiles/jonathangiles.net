		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Well, barring any mail arriving from the Upper Hutt hospital regarding giving me a public funded operation, I am now lined up for surgery privately on June 29th.</p>

<p>On a related note, I am now accepting donations to the "fund Jo's arm operation fund". The operation is costing $6000, but thankfully health insurance reduces that to only $2000, so that's better.</p>

<p>So, here's hoping that this surgery can begin my path to recovery (after the last one was a bit of a false start).</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jonathan.</p>
