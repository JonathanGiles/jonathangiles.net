<p><div>Today I'm headed off to Wellington to attend a 'hand-clinic'. No, I'm not into hands like that <img src="http://jogiles.spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif">Ã‚&nbsp;I've got a meeting with four doctors who specialise in hand and arm problems. Apparently they only do it four times a year and meet with 8 people on each occasion - so I'm special (although I'd rather not be obviously).</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>Chances are the next step will be them recommending another round of surgery exploring my arm in further depth, seeing as the last operation didn't find anyting wrong.</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>The annoying thing is that things are still getting worse, and I'm pretty much typing fulltime using just one hand. So I'm really keen to see things improve, and I hope surgery may be able to at least stop any further deprovement, and then I'll just keep on with my physio.</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>Wish me luck,</p>
