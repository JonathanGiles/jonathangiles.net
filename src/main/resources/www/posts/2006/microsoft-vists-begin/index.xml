<p><div>Tomorrow and Friday Paul and entourage from Microsoft will be at Massey. Do come along. It's important to me: All Microsoft posters were ripped down almost instantaneously after being put up, and I think Microsoft would rather present to people rather than an empty room.<img src="http://jogiles.spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_regular.gif"></div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>I can only summise that people really like Microsoft (or me), and want a Microsoft poster (or one with my handwriting on it) to put upÂ&nbsp;at their own place. Thats understandable, but imagine how much better getting free Microsoft stuff would be, and learning about the stuff Microsoft is doing this year for usÂ&nbsp;(or alternatively....meeting me.....bah...who am I kidding <img src="http://jogiles.spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif">)</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>So, those places and times again:</div></p>
<p><div></p>
<p><div>Thursday, 16th March, AH2 from 11am to 12 noon.</div></p>
<p><div>Friday, 17th March, AH3 from 1pm to 2pm</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>See you there,</div></p>
