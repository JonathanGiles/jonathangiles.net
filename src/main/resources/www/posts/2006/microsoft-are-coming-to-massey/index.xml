		<Content><![CDATA[<p>If you're free this Thursday, Paul and Xiang from Microsoft will be presenting in AgHort 2 from 2pm-3pm. There will be a demo on some of the Microsoft Atlas technologies, and they will be looking for someone to take over the roll of Microsoft student ambassador/student partner, which was what I did this year.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
