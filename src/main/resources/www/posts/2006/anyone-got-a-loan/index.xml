		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I've been spending the last few weeks looking at houses with Julia (the fiancee). It's kind of depressing knowing that I'm going to need to go to the banks and try to get a loan on my income, which as a student may be ok, but it's certainly not going to satisfy any bank. On top of that, looking at the online calculators, it's crazy to think that a small loan will be payed back in double (nearly triple) by the time we pay it all off. Didn't Einstein say compound interest was the 8th wonder of the world?</p>

<p>Looking through another nice house today, and meeting with a mortgage broker tomorrow. It's strange, I've never had problems in the past with having a little bit of money, but now that I want to borrow $120000 to $150000, I all of a sudden have a feeling of disinterest in purchasing a house <img src="http://jogiles.spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_regular.gif"></p>

<p>So, I'm accepting donations to the 'House Jo and Julia Fund'. Come on, let's spread the joy to a happily engaged couple <img src="http://jogiles.spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_wink.gif">. Donations would be happily accepted, and could help with tax writeoffs <img src="http://jogiles.spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif">.</p>

<p>Jo.</p>
