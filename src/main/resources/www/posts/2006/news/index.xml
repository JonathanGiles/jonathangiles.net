		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Well, I don't know if I ever mentioned it, but my wedding day has been pushed back by one day, to allow for Julia and I to get everything we want. It is now January 7th, next year.</p>

<p>In other news, I must thank the people spamming my blog with dubious trackbacks, it certainly is worthwhile advertising their garbage on this blog, as my 1500 total visits since January or so will most certainly be following these links :P</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jonathan.</p>
