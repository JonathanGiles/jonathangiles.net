		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Ok, This is my new blog - I think this'll be better for me as it means I have a lot more control over the underlying blog software (compared to what I had on my MSN Live Spaces blog). If you're wanting any particular content in here, let me know - you should all know my particular areas of research (but to bring everyone up to date, my research is particularly surrounding plugin-based software, and I am just beginning research into semantic web technologies for the next few years).</p>

<p>Hopefully over the next few days this site will be finished off, then I need to focus some attention on my other important website: the website for my company Novix Ltd.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Well, all previous blog entries have had their formatting updated, and now they look much better. I still have a bit more work to do, but overall wordpress is a good piece of blogging software.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jonathan.</p>
