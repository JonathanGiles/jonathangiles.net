<p><div>What should one do when they are overloaded with work? Clearly it's plan a week long holiday in the (hopefully) sunny lakeside√Ç&nbsp;village of Kuratau. Therefore, I won't be around between Feb 12th to Feb 19th. Any emails will remain unanswered until then, but if there is anything urgent I'm always available on my cellphone (0211 089 038).</div></p>

<p><div>I've found recently that I find it impossible to turn down work, and in fact often actively seek it out. With three weeks until Massey is back into action, I have many weeks worth of work to do before I'll be ready for Massey again.</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>What should one do to overcome this? I'm naturally drawn to the TV or spending my time with Julia - I can't pull all-nighters coding away. Any pointers, or should I just 'sharpen up' with Lift Plus?</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>Night,</div></p>
