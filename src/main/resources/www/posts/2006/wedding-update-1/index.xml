		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Here is the church Julia and I are to be married in:</p>

<p><img alt="Picture of Aokautere Church" id="image28" src="/content/2006/10/image79_lrg.jpg"></p>
<p>James should recognise it: he drives past it daily to get to Massey. It's the Aokautere Community Church, and is the reason we changed the date of our wedding to the Sunday.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jonathan</p>
