<p><div>Hey,</div></p>
<p><div></div></p>
<p><div>I tried to get some prizes for the upcoming event, and have succeeded. I was hoping for more, but seeing as Microsoft is touring NZ presently, it's probably fair for now. So anyway, I'll have on me two copies of both Flight Simulator 2004 and Office 2003 Professional.</div></p>

<p><div>Cheers,</div></p>
