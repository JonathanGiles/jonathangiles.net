		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I must be a bit of a broken record, but the work this semester so far has been amazingly time consuming. None of it hard, just time consuming. I haven't had much spare time to put my feet up, and its really starting to catch up with me.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to the end of next week, as that is the end of the first half of the semester. I think we get about two weeks break. Between now and then, I need to finish my Haskell assignment (20% of paper), finish my programming languages report (20% of same paper), write an analysis of the music industry wrt IT/IS (3% of a paper), write up a discussion of problems with the current version of research, draw up use cases to motivate its redevelopment, and give a 30 minute (plus questions) seminar on the Java Plugin Framework.</p>

<p>The joy of fourth year and not having many exams....I think I have one and a half exams this semester for my five papers.</p>

<p>Over the break at this point in time I only have (so far...) to do a report on some application, more of my research, and probably write a few more reports, and sleep.</p>

<p>Hopefully everyone else out there is having a better time!</p>

<p>If anyone wants to hook me up with an xbox 360 (and I'm looking at Paul), I'll more than happily accept it ;), simply for rest and procrastination purposes.</p>

<p>Jonathan.</p>
