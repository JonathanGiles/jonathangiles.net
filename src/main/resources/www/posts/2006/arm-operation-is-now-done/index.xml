		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Well, operation is now over. I'm fully one-handed now - my left arm is half plastered up so it ain't moving :)</p>

<p>I'll keep this short:</p>
<p>* Good operation - surgeon found a 2cm long compression on my nerve, and cleaned it all up.</p>
<p>* At the moment the hand is no better, but it will hopefully improve in the coming months.</p>

<p>I was really wasted after the op, so I ended up staying the night - and so did Julia in the bed next to me, so I didn't need to call the nurses at all in the night &lt;:)</p>

<p>I think I'll leave it at that,</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jonathan</p>
