<p><div id="msgcns!9C7F360F305C1AA0!173">Waylon has a good summary of the two days the ambassadors spent up in Auckland on his <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/waylonkenning/blog/cns%21BBF991E3194429B4%21227.entry">blog here</a>. A few other points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We got to play Xbox 360 - very cool.</li>
	<li>Lift Plus (the energy drink) have sponsored us, so expect to see lots of drinks around campus when we have presentations.</li>
	<li>Woosh Wireless have sponsored us, but they aren't yet in Palmy, so that's a moot point for anyone at Massey.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really needÂ&nbsp;to find aÂ&nbsp;good reason to do some MS dev work, just to get an appreciation for and understanding ofÂ&nbsp;Visual Studio, etc.</p>

<p>Ah well, I'm really tired, so I'll keep it short.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing the other ambassadors photos (*hint*) - the ones up so far are awesome,</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Jonathan Giles.</div></p>
