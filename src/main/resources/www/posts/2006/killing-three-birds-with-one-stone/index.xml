		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Really busy with Massey, it'll be good to get this semester out if the way (even though it just started). Presently my TODO list includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Preparing my seminar presentation for Object-oriented Software Engineering</li>
	<li>Meetings with lecturers around Massey for projects and my research</li>
	<li>Haskell programming assignment *shudders*</li>
	<li>My research</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how does this link my the title? Well, I've managed to get the work I've been doing on Centruflow to become my research project, and I've managed to get my seminar topic for another paper to be about something I'm researching for my research project. That's sure to save some time....</p>
