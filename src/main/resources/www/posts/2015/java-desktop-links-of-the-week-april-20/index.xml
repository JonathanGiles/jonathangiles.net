<p>JavaFX</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Gluon</strong>&nbsp;guys (as well as members of the JavaFX community, such as <strong>Jens Deters</strong> and <strong>José Pereda</strong>) have announced the availability of the <a href="http://gluonhq.com/charm-down-available/">open source 'Down' library</a>, a sub-component of the <a href="http://gluonhq.com/products/charm/">forth-coming (and commercial) Gluon Charm library</a>. Down is useful for mobile JavaFX application developers to create software that makes use of specific elements of the mobile hardware that they run on.</li>
	<li><strong>René Jahn</strong> has posted about '<a href="http://blog.sibvisions.com/2015/04/18/javafx-android-live-preview/">JavaFX + Android + Live Preview</a>'. This post talks about using their (commercial)&nbsp;VisionX product and its live preview feature, to develop JavaFX applications for Android (using <a href="http://www.javafxports.org">JavaFXPorts</a>) without having to deploy to the device for testing.</li>
	<li><strong>Chris Newland</strong> has posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZf0j4GUFYM">second 'demo scene' video</a> created using JavaFX. It is really quite impressive seeing JavaFX put through its paces and not breaking a sweat at 60fps.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for this week. Catch you again in a weeks time! :-)</p>
