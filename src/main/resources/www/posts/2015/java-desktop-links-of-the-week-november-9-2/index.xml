		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;">JavaOne is over and it's time to get back into work. The good news is that JavaOne 2016 is in mid-September, so only ~10 months away now! :-) Here are the links that come out over the last few weeks whilst I've been away at JavaOne. I'm sure I've missed some but feel free to email them to me and I'll include them next week.</span></p>
