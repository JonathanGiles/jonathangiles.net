		<Content><![CDATA[<p>A relatively quiet week this week, with perhaps people looking forward to a little rest and relaxation coming up later this month. Regardless, I hope you find something of interest in the links below.</p>
<h4>Swing</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ken Orr</strong>, shortly before announcing <a href="http://explodingpixels.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/heading-to-apple/">he is heading to work at Apple</a>, posted about how you can <a href="http://explodingpixels.wordpress.com/2009/12/02/creating-the-itunes-navigation-header-button/">recreate the iTunes navigation header button using Java2D</a> and announced the <a href="http://explodingpixels.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/sea-glass-version-01/">availability of the Sea Glass Look and Feel 0.1 release</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Rob Camick</strong> posts <a href="http://tips4java.wordpress.com/2009/11/29/text-prompt/">how to add prompt text to a text field</a>. Prompt text is text that appears within the text field when the user has not typed anything.</li>
	<li><strong>Nick D'Arcy</strong> let me know about his blog post on <a href="http://devandwhateverelse.blogspot.com/2009/12/nice-jxlayer-lockableui.html">creating a lockable UI with JXLayer</a>. Whilst the first few screenshots don't look great, the last screenshot should show the potential of this approach.</li>
</ul>
<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Jasper Potts</strong>, via <a href="http://www.fxexperience.com">fxExperience.com</a>, blogged to ensure people know that <a href="http://fxexperience.com/2009/12/inkscape-has-save-as-javafx-support/">Inkscape can now save your drawings as JavaFX assets</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Jim Weaver</strong> covered the talks given by <strong>Richard Bair</strong> and <strong>Jasper Potts</strong> at Devoxx, <a href="http://learnjavafx.typepad.com/weblog/2009/12/javafx-13-leakage-at-devoxx-and-%C3%B8redev.html">who presented (for the first time) what we've got coming up in JavaFX 1.3</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Chris Wright</strong> and <strong>Jim Weaver</strong> continue their series of posts covering what is new in JavaFX 1.2, this week focusing on the <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javafx/v1_2_charts/">new JavaFX charts API</a>.</li>
	<li>Whilst NetBeans 6.7 doesn't support automatically formatting JavaFX script, NetBeans 6.8 apparently will. Whilst we wait for the final release of that, there is a <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/beautifying-javafx-script?utm_source=feedburner">workaround available for NetBeans 6.7</a> if you're really desperate for automatic code formatting.</li>
	<li><span><strong>Mitch Pronschinske</strong> </span>asks <strong>Max Katz</strong> (of Exadel JavaFX plugin for Eclipse fame) if there is a <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/there-lack-advertising-javafx">lack of advertising for JavaFX</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Jeff Frieson</strong> has written a comprehensive article covering the <a href="http://today.java.net/article/2009/11/30/learn-about-javafxs-apis-reading-rss-and-atom-newsfeeds">JavaFX API's for reading RSS and Atom feeds</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Stephen Chin</strong> has blogged about <a href="http://steveonjava.com/2009/12/06/2009-devoxx-posts-netbeans-javafx-designer-preview/">his Devoxx 2009 talks</a>. He provides links to the videos on parleys.com, which is a paid site, although over time the videos will become available for free.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Griffon</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Andres Almiray</strong> reposted parts <a href="http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/building_rich_swing_applications_with1">two</a> and <a href="http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/building_rich_swing_applications_with2">three</a> of his Building Rich Swing Applications with Groovy article originally published in GroovyMag.</li>
	<li><strong>Jim Shingler</strong> wanted to see how easy it is to use SwingX painters in Griffon, and as it turns out, <a href="http://jshingler.blogspot.com/2009/11/griffon-painter-demo.html">it was trivial</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's another week down. Have a great week ahead everyone, and I'll catch you again in a weeks time.</p>
