		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick post to announce that today I went for and got my Sun Certified Java Programmer (SCJP) 6 certification. The exam is actually relatively quite difficult, as it really requires a good understanding of the Java language, and in most cases people rely on their IDE to catch their errors. For this reason, it pays to do a bit of study prior to sitting the exam. In the process of doing my study, I actually wrote up a fairly decent 12 page document that covers the areas where I didn't understand things well enough. It proved to be a good study guide in my opinion.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in reading it prior to their SCJP exam, let me know and I'll polish it up and make it available.</p>
