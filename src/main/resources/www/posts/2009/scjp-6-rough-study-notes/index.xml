		<Content><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/2009/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/scjp-6-notes-jonathangiles.pdf/">Here are the SCJP 6 study notes I mentioned I wrote.</a> They are rough. I wrote them for my own purposes, so they are brief and highlight the main things I had to remind myself. It is by no means perfect - there are typos, poor layout choices, etc. Unless you're me, it probably doesn't make sense :-)</p>

<p>I apologise for the brevity. I tried to keep the page count to 12. Therefore, if you are printing, I personally recommend you print two pages per sheet of paper, meaning it'll take 6 pages and be quite readable.</p>

<p>Regardless, people have asked for them, so enjoy. If you find I am wrong, or that I could organise it better, let me know and I may try to maintain it.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
