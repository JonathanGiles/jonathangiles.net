		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Well, it turns out that I'm going to be at JavaOne. I'm pretty sure this is New Zealand's proudest moment.</p>

<p>If you are going to be at JavaOne, and you read this blog, then I'd love to catch up! <a href="mailto:jonathan@jonathangiles.net">Email me</a> , and let me know when you're available. I'm really looking forward to catching up with everyone, and at the moment I have nothing planned for any of my evenings, and my Saturday 6th June is completely free.</p>
