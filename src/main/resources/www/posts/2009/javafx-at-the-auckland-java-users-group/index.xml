		<Content><![CDATA[<p>It seems to be the season of JavaFX talks, given the talk given by <a href="http://fxexperience.com/2009/12/silicon-valley-javafx-jug/">Richard Bair to the San Francisco JavaFX Users Group</a> and <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/?p=313">Sten Anderson's upcoming talk to the Chicago Java Users Group</a>. Similarly, I've been asked to talk to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/auckland-jug/calendar/12054076/">Auckland Java Users Group</a>, where my topic will obviously be on JavaFX, now and in the future.</p>

<p>Come along to get to know what is happening in the world of JavaFX, but if you can't, I'll be posting my slides over at <a href="http://www.fxexperience.com">fxexperience.com</a>, which is a great site I'm involved in for JavaFX.</p>
