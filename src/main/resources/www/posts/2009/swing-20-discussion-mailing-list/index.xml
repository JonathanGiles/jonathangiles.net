		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Hello all,</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Project Kenai got back to me, so I have moved everything from Java.net onto Project Kenai. The new address is <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/swing2">http://kenai.com/projects/swing2</a>. Please <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/swing2/lists">subscribe to the mailing here</a> and say hello.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Just a quick post: Given that I haven't heard from project kenai about hosting a Swing 2 project there, I have decided to setup and move the Swing 2.0 discussion to mailing lists. I see some people have already subscribed to the list, but for others interested in following and contributing to a Swing 2.0 discussion, please <a href="https://s2.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">subscribe to the dev mailing list</a> and say hello.</span></p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jonathan</p>
