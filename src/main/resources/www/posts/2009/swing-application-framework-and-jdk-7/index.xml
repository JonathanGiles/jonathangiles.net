		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I was just prompted by a reader of this website regarding the state of the Swing Application Framework, which up to now has been delayed and thought to be <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/archive/2009/08/19/saf-and-jdk7">unlikely for inclusion in JDK 7</a>. However, now that JDK 7 has been delayed until September (or so) 2010, perhaps there is time to get SAF, or <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/alexfromsun/archive/2009/11/16/other-swing-frameworks">one of the forks</a>, further implemented and pushed into the actual JDK 7 release.</p>

<p>What do you think? Please leave a comment.</p>
