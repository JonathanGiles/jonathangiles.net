<ul>
	<li><strong>Alexander Casall</strong> has a post on jaxenter detailing&nbsp;<a href="https://jaxenter.com/20-javafx-real-world-applications-123653.html">20 JavaFX real-world applications</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Johan Vos</strong> will be giving a free&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java/entry/java_on_mobile">Oracle Virtual Technology Summit talk about Java on Mobile</a> in April and May. Sign up now!</li>
	<li><strong>Hendrik Ebbers</strong> has this week posted about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guigarage.com/2016/02/javafx-and-css-pseudo-classes/">JavaFX and CSS Pseudo Classes</a>. Knowing how to work with pseudo classes in JavaFX CSS is a very useful skill to have!</li>
	<li><strong>Gerrit Grunwald</strong> has also been iterating on his <a href="https://github.com/HanSolo/Medusa">Medusa gauge library</a>. I won't even bother to mention a version number this week, because it is probably already wrong :-)</li>
	<li><strong>Thomas Nield</strong> has released an <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX">updated version of RxJavaFX</a> to improve interop between RxJava and JavaFX.</li>
