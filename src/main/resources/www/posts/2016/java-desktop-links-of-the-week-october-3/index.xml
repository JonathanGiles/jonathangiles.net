<ul>
 	<li><strong>Rahman Usta</strong> has released on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/rahmanusta/TerminalFX">TerminalFX</a>, a JavaFX-based terminal emulator.</li>
 	<li>I was pinged by <strong>Garry Taylor</strong> from The Escapers about their new JavaFX-based (commercial) application for <a href="http://theescapers.com/product.php?product=lucid3">building CSS animations for the web</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! I said it was a quiet week! :-)</p>
