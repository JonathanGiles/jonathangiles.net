 	<li><strong>Thierry Wasylczenko</strong> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/twasyl/jstackfx">JStackFX</a>, which provides a user interface to analyse thread dumps generated by the Java jstack tool. It looks very nice!</li>

 	<li><strong>Alessio Vinerbi</strong> has released an updated version of his open source&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/alexbodogit/AnchorFX">AnchorFX docking framework</a> for JavaFX. This looks very nice.</li>
