As I noted in my last post...*checks notes*....a year and a half ago, I've [moved this site to be statically generated](/posts/2020/website-overhaul/), and because I'm an idiot, I have written this static site using my own [static site generator](https://github.com/JonathanGiles/sitebuilder), and I even tested it locally on my own [simple HTTP server](https://github.com/jonathangiles/teenyhttpd). 

However, because of late I've written a lot of markdown, I've not particularly enjoyed the requirement that I imposed on myself that the posts on this site would be written in XML. Fortunately, today, after some hacking on TeenyHttpd, SiteBuilder, and my [JonathanGiles.net implementation of SiteBuilder](https://github.com/JonathanGiles/jonathangiles.net), I am now able to support writing my blog posts in markdown, which makes me incredibly happy :-)

I know I should have just used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and moved on with my life, but sometimes the thrill is in the coding, rather than actually using the tool. When I want to actually be productive, e.g. with the [Java Best Practices](http://java.jonathangiles.net), I do use Jekyll, so I'm not a complete idiot...

In any case, maybe, hopefully, this will encourage me to get back into blogging and sharing more about what I am doing in my day job and elsewhere. Let's see...
