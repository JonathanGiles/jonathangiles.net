 	<li>The big news in the last week is the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html">release of Java 9</a>, and with it updates to JavaFX. This is, of course, a major release which brings with it a lot of changes, mostly around modularity, but there is a huge amount of engineering effort in many less visible areas. I recommend all developers start exploring Java 9 as time permits.</li>
 	<li>With Java 9 out, the libraries we use all need to make the necessary changes to work under the Java 9. This week there have been a huge number of tweets and release announcements of updated versions of various libraries to support Java 9. Libraries in the Java desktop area that have announced Java 9 support include <a href="http://controlsfx.org">ControlsFX</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jensd.de/wordpress/?p=2686">FontAwesomeFX</a>.</li>
 	<li>As well as libraries, <strong>Gluon</strong> has released an <a href="http://gluonhq.com/new-scene-builder-releases/">updated Scene Builder</a>, for both Java 8 and Java 9.</li>
 	<li><strong>Jens Deters</strong> has released a <a href="http://www.jensd.de/wordpress/?p=2698">fix for MQTT.fx</a> for a bug only present for users of MacOS High Sierra.</li>
 	<li><strong>Thomas Nield</strong> has updated RxJavaFX with a <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX/releases/tag/2.2.0">minor release</a> to tweak an API.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gerrit Grunwald</strong> has returned to his <a href="https://github.com/HanSolo/tilesfx">tilesfx dashboard library</a>, fixing some issues.</li>
 	<li><strong>Andres Almiray</strong> has posted about&nbsp;<a href="http://andresalmiray.com/articles/define-custom-behavior-in-fxml-with-fxmlloader/">defining custom behaviour in FXML with FXMLLoader</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Jyloo Software</strong> has a blog post on the <a href="http://www.jyloo.com/news/?pubId=1506537005000">UI scaling support in Synthetica V3</a>.</li>
