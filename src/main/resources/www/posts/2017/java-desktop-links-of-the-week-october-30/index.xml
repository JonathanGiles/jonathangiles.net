		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Due to excessive levels of travel in the past week, I was unable to pull together the links for last week. I have tried to keep track of the links as best as I could, but I apologise if I miss any today. Please, <a href="mailto:jonathan@jonathangiles.net">let me know</a> and I'll be sure to post them next week.</p>
