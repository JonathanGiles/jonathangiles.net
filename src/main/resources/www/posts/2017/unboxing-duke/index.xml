		<Content><![CDATA[<p>One does not simply receive a Dukes Choice award - they experience it :-) I've heard in the past from friends who have received the Dukes Choice award in the mail that it is quite a process, so I decided to document the extent of packaging involved in shipping Duke from California to New Zealand...it is, considerable :-)</p>

<p>For those wondering why a Dukes Choice award turned up on my doorstep, I refer you to the announcement that <a href="/posts/2017/congratulations-controlsfx/">ControlsFX won the award at JavaOne 2017</a>. I am incredibly proud of this project, and as I said then - this is an award for everyone involved.</p>

<p>Here's the unboxing of Duke:</p>
