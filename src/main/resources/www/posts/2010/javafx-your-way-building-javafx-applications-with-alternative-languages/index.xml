		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Here are the slides from the session that <a href="http://www.steveonjava.com">Stephen Chin</a> and I presented today at JavaOne. The talk was titled '<a href="https://download.jonathangiles.net/downloads/presentations/2010/JavaFXYourWay.pdf">JavaFX Your Way: Building JavaFX Applications with Alternative Languages</a>'. I think overall it went very well, and there was hopefully some useful content for attendees, and now you, to think about. I look forward to ongoing discussions on this topic, and hopefully community support.</p>

<p>Enjoy :-)</p>
