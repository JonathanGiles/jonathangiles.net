		<Content><![CDATA[<p>This weeks post comes to you from Santa Clara in the heart of Silicon Valley, so pardon the brevity, and due to my travel please excuse me if I missed any links.</p>

<p>This week saw the release of JavaFX 1.3, which comes with a heap of improvements. Rather than repeat the details here, I have links to the main links below. Let's get into the news.</p>
<h4>Swing</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Kirill Grouchnikov</strong> has been <a href="http://www.pushing-pixels.org/?p=1786">improving the breadcrumb component</a>, including making it use the Flamingo command button component. If you're using the breadcrumb component, you shouldn't notice any difference other than a more polished look.</li>
	<li><strong>Eugene Ryzhikov</strong> has announced the <a href="http://mcoj.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/taskdialog-1-0-official-release/">1.0 release of his Swing TaskDialog project</a>. It looks to be a very useful component, so check it out.</li>
</ul>
<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li>As mentioned, JavaFX 1.3 came out this week. You can <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/javafx/entry/javafx_1_3_released_delivers">read the official blog post</a> about it, <a href="http://javafx.com/docs/articles/javafx1-3.jsp">check out the new features</a>, and read the <a href="http://javafx.com/docs/articles/porting-guide-javafx1-3.jsp">migration guide</a> to understand what was changed since 1.2.</li>
