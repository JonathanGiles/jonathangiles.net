		<Content><![CDATA[<p>It's nearly the end of my time in California - I head back to New Zealand tomorrow evening - but before that I need to post a new Java desktop links of the week. This week there were a tonne of posts, and so this post is very long. I had to keep my comments to a minimum as otherwise the post would have been even longer. Let's get into it!</p>
<h4>Swing</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Kirill Grouchnikov</strong> has created a new<em> </em>JScrollablePanel as part of the Flamingo project which is a <a href="http://www.pushing-pixels.org/?p=1793">reusable component for scrolling panels whose content extends past the visible area</a>. This might be useful to you in your application.</li>
	<li><strong>Gerrit Grunwald</strong> has created an <a href="http://www.jug-muenster.de/fxg-to-java2d-converter-555/">FXG to Java2D converter</a>. Check it out if you want an easy way to get your vector graphics into a Java application.</li>
	<li><strong>Alex Ruiz</strong> has announced the <a href="http://alexruiz.developerblogs.com/?p=1149">release of FEST-Swing 1.2rc</a>. This is the last release before 1.2 final. If no regressions are found,  1.2rc will be promoted to 1.2 final within a month.</li>
	<li><strong>Mikael Grev</strong> has released <a href="http://www.miglayout.com/mavensite/changes-report.html">two updates to MiGLayout in the past few days</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Nick</strong> has blogged about using <a href="http://devandwhateverelse.blogspot.com/2010/04/scala-swing-combobox.html">Scala Swing to build user interfaces</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Following on from his first <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2010/04/brief-introduction-to-styling-controls.html">JavaFX 1.3 CSS post last week</a>, <strong>Dean Iverson</strong> has continued with two further posts discussing what's new in JavaFX 1.3 CSS support. They are highly recommended reading. The first post covers the <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2010/04/advanced-javafx-control-styling.html">topic in detail</a>, and the second asks <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2010/04/so-whats-it-all-good-for.html">what this is all good for</a>?</li>
	<li>Futher to these posts by Dean, the JavaFX documentation team has also posted about <a href="http://javafx.com/docs/articles/UIControls/theming.jsp">how to style with CSS</a>.</li>
	<li>The <strong>FX Experience</strong> blog has two new posts detailing the improvements to ListView in 1.3, in particular the introduction of cells. The first post discusses the <a href="http://fxexperience.com/2010/04/dynamic-cell-sizes/">support for dynamically variable row sizes</a>, and the second post dives into <a href="http://fxexperience.com/2010/04/new-to-javafx-1-3-cells/">how to create cellFactories</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Alex Ruiz</strong> has announced that he has <a href="http://alexruiz.developerblogs.com/?p=1163">made progress in testing JavaFX application user interfaces</a>. This allows for work to continue with the FEST-JavaFX project designed to make testing JavaFX applications easier.</li>
	<li>TimeShot is a very interesting JavaFX application I came across this week. It can create some <a href="http://timeshot.inevo.pt/">interesting effects with photos</a>, which you can see, and try for yourself, at the TimeShot website.</li>
	<li><strong>Johannes Schneider</strong> has done a tonne of posts recently, so I can only cover the blog titles here.
