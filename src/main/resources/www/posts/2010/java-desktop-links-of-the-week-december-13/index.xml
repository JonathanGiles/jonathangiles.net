		<Content><![CDATA[<p>An incredibly quiet week this week, with just two links worth mentioning. I'm guessing we'll have a quiet few weeks ahead of us as everyone has a well-deserved break. For now however, here's the Java desktop links for this week.</p>
<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Max Katz</strong> has blogged about <a href="http://mkblog.exadel.com/2010/12/java-on-the-client-again/">Java on the clientâ€¦ again</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Josh Marinacci</strong> has announced that <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/joshy/archive/2010/12/09/amino-swing-crazy-delicious">Amino now has beta support for integrating Swing within it</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that was a short and sweet links of the week. Hopefully things might pick up again in the next few weeks, and certainly early next year with the start of the early access program for JavaFX 2.0 due to start in Q1 2011. Until next week, keep out of trouble and have a good week :-)</p>
