<p>I've just presented the Java API Best Practices presentation at <a href="http://devoxx.pl">Devoxx Poland</a>. The presentation is similar to the one I <a href="/posts/2018/java-api-design-best-practices-slide-deck-now-available/">presented last week at JDK.io</a>, but in my opinion is much improved based on community feedback and additional time to iterate. There was also a far larger audience today, with around 650 attendees compared with around 100 last week at JDK.io. I also think generally the presentation went better (despite the stress of a much larger audience), so I look forward to sharing the video of this presentation once it becomes available.</p>

<p>Below I've posted a few photos I received from my Twitter stream, and of course you can <a href="/java-api-design-best-practices.html">download the slides for your reference</a>. Even if you read through the slides from JDK.io last week (and there were 4200+ downloads at last check!), I suggest you consider downloading this latest slide deck and deleting the old version :-)</p>

<p>The next time I present this session is at JavaZone in Oslo, Norway, in September. Hopefully by then I will have received even more feedback and I will have an even better slide deck to offer!</p>
