		<Content><![CDATA[<p>A heap of links this week, with a lot of talk about JavaOne that starts next week. It sounds like it is going to be a great conference, and I wish I could be there (but as noted previously there is a pretty <a href="/posts/2013on-why-im-not-going-to-javaone/">valid reason why I won't be</a>). Anywho, enjoy the links, and for those going to JavaOne enjoy it - I'll be following via Twitter and the blogosphere :-)</p>
