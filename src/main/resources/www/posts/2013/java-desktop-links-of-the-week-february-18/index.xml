<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Richard Bair</strong> posted an <a href="http://fxexperience.com/2013/02/february-open-source-update/">open source status update</a>, and included some news about iOS and Android plans. It is important to note exactly what Richard is saying, which I think is fairly well <a href="http://tomsondev.bestsolution.at/2013/02/13/thoughts-on-javafx-for-android-and-ios/">summarised</a> by <strong>Tom Schindl</strong> over on his blog. This was also covered by <strong><a href="http://marxsoftware.blogspot.co.nz/2013/02/javafx-coming-soon-to-android-or-ios.html">Dustin Marx</a></strong>, <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/02/13/171227/oracle-open-sourcing-javafx-including-ios-and-android-ports">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/02/javafx-ios-android">InfoQ</a> and <a href="http://paritynews.com/software/item/627-oracle-to-open-source-ios-android-ports-of-javafx-soon">Parity News</a>, among others.</li>

There are a heap of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzvw-zzCMJ3xq5SgxL961IFE">JavaFX-related videos</a> in there, so you've got plenty to watch as time permits!</li>

	<li>I always enjoy seeing people discovering my APIs. This week <strong>Anton Epple</strong> showed the power of the <a href="http://jayskills.com/blog/2013/02/14/javafx-listview-with-custom-display/">pre-built cell factories</a> that have been shipping with JavaFX since 2.2.</li>

	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>mihosoft</strong> have posted a video of their <a href="http://mihosoft.eu/?p=429">scalable content functionality</a> that they recently pushed to JFXtras. It's quite interesting technology.</li>
