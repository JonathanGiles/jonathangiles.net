<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Claudine Zillmann</strong> blogged about <a href="http://www.guigarage.com/2013/10/aquafx-dressed-in-elements/">restyling AquaFX in different colours</a>. This really shows the power of CSS in JavaFX.</li>
	<li><a href="http://fxexperience.com/2013/10/announcing-controlsfx-8-0-2/">ControlsFX 8.0.2 was released this week</a>. This is a major release, including a bunch of new features (including SpreadsheetView, native dialog titlebars, HyperlinkLabel, and more), as well as a heap of bug fixes.</li>

	<li><strong>Tomas Mikula</strong> has posted code for his <a href="https://github.com/TomasMikula/CodeAreaFX">CodeAreaFX project</a>, which is a "text area for JavaFX that supports assigning style classes for ranges of text. It is intended as a base for code editors with syntax highlighting."</li>
	<li><strong>Bruno Borges</strong> has posted a video on YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG4YjRDL8Dg&amp;feature=youtube_gdata">introducing JavaFX on the Raspberry Pi</a>.</li>

	<li><strong>Chris Newland</strong> has posted his <a href="http://www.chrisnewland.com/jitwatch">JITWatch tool</a>, a JavaFX-based tool for understanding the behaviour of the Java HotSpot Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler during the execution of your program.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sven Ruppert</strong> has two posts this week.

</ul>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<ul>
	<li>I came across <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jo-widgets/">jo-widgets</a> this week, which is a project to provide a 'single sourcing GUI API for Java'. In other words, it provides a single API for you to write Java desktop applications, regardless of what the implementation actually is (e.g. SWT, Swing, JavaFX, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep up the really excellent work everyone, and I'll catch you all in a weeks time :-)</p>
