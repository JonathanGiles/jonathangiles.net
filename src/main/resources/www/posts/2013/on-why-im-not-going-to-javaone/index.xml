<p>People are wondering why I'm not going to JavaOne this year. The answer is: my wife and I are expecting our first child late December 2013! This will be our first child and whilst I'd really like to be at JavaOne, being home is more important this year. I'll follow along with the JavaOne announcements via twitter, and I may also take the opportunity to use my blog to bore you with more personal news items! :-)</p>

<p>Here's photographic proof (click for bigger pictures, if for some reason you are interested in ultrasound photos of my future child):</p>
