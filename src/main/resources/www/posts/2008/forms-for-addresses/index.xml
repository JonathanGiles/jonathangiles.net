		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I just purchased a new Dell laptop. I quite like Dell, but their online process leaves a little to be desired, as shown in the image below:</p>

<p><a href="/content/2008/06/dell-order-process.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160" title="dell-order-process" src="/content/2008/06/dell-order-process.png" alt="" width="500" height="195"></a></p>

<p>Why are there only four 'State and Country' options, those being Auckland, Christchurch, Rotorua (?) and Wellington? I conveniently don't belong to any of those 'states', although I do live in Palmerston North, which is located in New Zealand.</p>

<p>I actually had to ring Dell up, wait on their phone system for 10 minutes, and then be told "I always tell people Michael Dell didn't study his geography - just choose Wellington". I then asked - how do I specify Palmerston North - she wasn't sure - so I just added it in the line above my suburb.</p>

<p>My order is now being shipped to:</p>
<p><table style="height: 105px;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="217"></p>
<p><tbody></p>
<p><tr></p>
<p><td width="30%"></td></p>
<p><td width="70%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">3a Huata Place</span></td></p>
<p></tr></p>
<p><tr></p>
<p><td width="30%"></td></p>
<p><td width="70%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Palmerston North</span></td></p>
<p></tr></p>
<p><tr></p>
<p><td width="30%"></td></p>
<p><td width="70%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Riverdale</span></td></p>
<p></tr></p>
<p><tr></p>
<p><td width="30%"></td></p>
<p><td width="70%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Jonathan Giles-Ph:06 3551198</span></td></p>
<p></tr></p>
<p><tr></p>
<p><td width="30%"></td></p>
<p><td width="70%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">4410</span></td></p>
<p></tr></p>
<p><tr></p>
<p><td width="30%"></td></p>
<p><td width="70%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Wel </span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">, </span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">New Zealand</span></td></p>
<p></tr></p>
<p></tbody></table></p>
<p>Which is some frankenstein city that spans over 200 kilometres. Additionally, my suburb (Riverdale) now subsumes my city (Palmerston North), which are both subsumed by the fact they are apparently located in 'Wel', New Zealand.</p>

<p>Ah well, here's hoping it turns up here...but if anyone sees a lost looking courier in the next few weeks, can you point them my way?</p>
