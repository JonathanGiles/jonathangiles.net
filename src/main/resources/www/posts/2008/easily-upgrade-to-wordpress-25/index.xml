		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I just upgraded my Wordpress blog to Wordpress 2.5. I only touched FTP once to upload a new 'automatic upgrader' plugin. This plugin then walked me through the entire process of upgrading to wordpress 2.5. It took 5 minutes to do.</p>

<p>If you want to do this to upgrade, but don't want to go through all the hassle of backing up your files and database, consider using this plugin - it does it all for you.</p>
