		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Branching and merging is supposed to be the benefit of Subversion, but every time I try to use it I get burnt. I finally spent a few hours reading up on it all, and found <a href="http://svn.collab.net/subclipse/help/index.jsp?topic=/org.tigris.subversion.subclipse.doc/html/reference/merge.html">this rather useful site</a> that explains it quite well. Well worth reading if you're using Subversion.</p>
