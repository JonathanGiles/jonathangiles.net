<p>Arrested Development is an incredibly funny TV show that was cancelled well before its prime. It only last 3 seasons, but is absolutely hilarious. If you can find it, I recommend you watch it. I try to watch all three seasons over a few weeks every year, and only just finished watching the whole three seasons over Christmas.</p>
