		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I do a bit of development work on the <a href="http://www.prefuse.org">prefuse</a> project. Recently a new branch has been created that is a port to Java 1.5 (i.e. it has generics, enumerations, etc). A lot of people are having trouble connecting to the relevant CVS branch, so to help them out I have posted it <a href="https://download.jonathangiles.net/downloads/prefuse-15.zip">here.</a></p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
