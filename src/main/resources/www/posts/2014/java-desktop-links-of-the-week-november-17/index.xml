	<li><strong>Tom Schindl</strong> has posted about <a href="http://tomsondev.bestsolution.at/2014/11/12/animated-path-morphing-in-javafx/">animated path morphing in JavaFX</a>, which looks quite cool :-)</li>
	<li><strong>Hendrik Ebbers</strong> has a post on creating <a href="http://www.guigarage.com/2014/11/hand-drawing-effect-javafx/">'hand-drawing' effects with JavaFX</a> which, again, looks cool :-)</li>
