		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sorry for the lack of posts, I have been incredibly busy working on my projects (let alone my masters!). I promise to make more of an effort on this blog in the coming weeks and months. For now, I have a link to my wedding photos, for all those interested in seeing what my day was like.</p>

<p>They can be seen <a href="http://www.freelancephotography.co.nz/Photos/2007/01/JonathanAndJulia">here</a>. Many thanks to Drew and Kate from <a href="http://www.freelancephotography.co.nz">Freelance Photography</a> for their awesome work.</p>
