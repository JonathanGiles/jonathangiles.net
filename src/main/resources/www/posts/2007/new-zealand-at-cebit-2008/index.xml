		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Given that New Zealand traditionally makes a big splash at CeBIT (<a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/5AABFF960C190695CC2572A70008F258">out-blinging the Aussies</a> no less), I was not surprised to receive an email from people involved with the PR for next years CeBIT already. They have set up a <a href="http://nzatcebit.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog that covers the build up to next years CeBIT event</a>, and I presume the results afterwards also. It will no doubt be interesting to watch what is going on, and I'm obviously very interested for the simple reason that the company I am involved with, <a href="http://www.centruflow.com" target="_blank">Centruflow Ltd</a>, is one of the companies exhibiting.</p>

<p>Just as a note - Cebit 2008 runs from March 4 - 9th I believe.</p>
