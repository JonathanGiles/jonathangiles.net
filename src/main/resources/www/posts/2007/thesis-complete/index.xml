		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Well, it has taken a year of my life, but my masters thesis is now complete and ready to be reviewed by my supervisor and external reviewers. In hindsight I am very happy I chose to do my masters rather than a PhD - my preference in life is to be more practical rather than theoretical. Right now I'm about to get back into full-time development of <a href="http://www.centruflow.com">Centruflow</a> leading in to CeBIT in March next year - we have some awesome technology in the pipeline!</p>

<p>My thesis is titled 'Improving Centruflow Using Semantic Web Technologies'. It weighs in at 139 pages or a little under 34,000 words. I start it by quoting Blaise Pascal "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time". The thesis covers a lot of software development detail but at the heart of it is a decent chunk of maths. This surprised even me, as I am by no means a mathematician.</p>

<p>You may notice my writing style has become severely 'relaxed' - too much 'proper' writing in my thesis has forced my brain to try to rebel - my sentences now instead flow into each other as a series of hyphens. :-)</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in checking out the thesis feel free to ask - I'm more than happy to hand send it out. The only reason I don't provide a link here is that I'd really like to know who is interested.</p>
