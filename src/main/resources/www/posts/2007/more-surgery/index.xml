		<Content><![CDATA[<p>After seeing my surgeon again today it seems almost completely certain that I will be having another surgery next year on my left arm. This surgery will be to take some tendons from my arm and map them to my fingers and thumb. This surgery is imaginatively named a 'tendon transfer', and will theoretically provide my fingers with the functionality of being able to lift up, albeit all at once. In addition, my thumb will be given a brand new tendon also, meaning it too can be lifted.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, such a remapping of tendons is likely to severely screw with your brain, as what used to do one thing all of a sudden causes you to do another. This will be an interesting experience no doubt.</p>

<p>I hope the surgery goes well and gives me additional function to my relatively 'dead' arm. I'll keep posting more about it as time progresses.</p>
