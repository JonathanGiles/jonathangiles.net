		<Content><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lyx.org" target="_blank">Lyx</a> is a great editor, if you know nothing to a little about latex, but you want the professional results you get when you use latex. Basically, Lyx is an application that appears like a word processor, and handles all the latex formatting automagically.</p>

<p>I have been using Lyx for a number of years, having written a number of reports and theses with it, and am still learning plenty of cool stuff that it does. Lyx works on all major platforms I believe (I've used it in Linux and Windows only however).</p>

<p>If you're needing to write a report, use Lyx - you won't be disappointed! If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.</p>
