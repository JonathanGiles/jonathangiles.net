		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I know, I'm a bit slow and behind the times, but I have now implemented recaptcha on my website for comments to blog posts. I don't do it to overly burden you, my loyal readers, but I do like the cause and the technological approach to helping solve it.</p>

<p>It short, and to plagiarise directly, "reCAPTCHA asks commenters to read two words from a book. One of these words proves 	   that they are a human, not a computer. The other word is a word that a computer couldn't read. 	   Because the user is known to be a human, the reading of that word is probably correct. So you don't 	   get comment spam, and the world gets books digitized. Everybody wins! For details, visit 	   the <a href="http://recaptcha.net/">reCAPTCHA website</a>".</p>

<p>So, commenting on this blog is now good for the world - so get commenting :-)</p>
