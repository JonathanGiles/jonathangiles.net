		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I've just been informed that I have been added to <a href="http://planet.nztech.org">Planet NZTech</a>, which I must admit should hopefully result in the ratio of European vists to NZ visits hopefully correcting itself. The reason for this is that I'm a postgrad student at Massey University in Palmerston North researching semantic web technologies, and in particular the linking of such technologies into business applications. Semantic web research is really something that the Europeans seem to be heavily pursuing these days, but I'm really excited about the possibilities it opens up. I'll try my best to outline this in the future (my research is only just beginning).</p>

<p>This post is really to say hello to anyone who reads Planet NZTech, so.....hello!</p>
