		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I thought I'd just write to say that I hope everyone has a good Christmas and new year. My plans are simple - spending time at home with family and Julia (my fiancee).</p>

<p>Next year over the Summer break I plan to continue with my three software projects (Leopard Tutor, Centruflow, and Mandarax), and get out and enjoy the sun a bit. I'm planning to get away to Kuratau (at the southern end of Lake Taupo, and right on the beach), and Microsoft is flying me up to Auckland for an orientation as to my role as a student ambassador for Massey University here in Palmy. I'm hoping to come up a few days early with Julia and make a mini-holiday out of it as well - 4 or so days away from the laptop. Yes, I know laptops are portable, but having been on it so much these last few months with massey, it'll be nice to get away from it for a bit.</p>

<p>Anyway, one other thing - I have a bad hand - nerve damage up by the elbow in fact. It's still getting worse, and causes my fingers on my left hand to be very weak and droop. As you can imagine this makes typing quite a long process. Hence my lack of updates. I have already had one operation to try and fix it (in April 2005), but they couldn't find the problem. I'm likely in the next few months to need another operation, and hopefully this time the (new) surgeon can help out.</p>

<p>Catch you later,</p>

<p>Jo.</p>
