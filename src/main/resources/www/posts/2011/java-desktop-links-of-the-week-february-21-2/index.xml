		<Content><![CDATA[<p>A quiet week this week in the world of the Java desktop. However, with the first EA builds of JavaFX 2.0 coming out, I have seen a lot of very interesting projects being started. I've also heard from a lot of people how they find the APIs to be very good, so I'm pleased (although I'm always on the lookout for feedback) :-)</p>
<h4>Swing</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Thanks to everyone that let me know that <strong>Jyloo Software</strong> announced the release of <a href="http://www.jyloo.com/news/?pubId=1297422319000">Synthetica V2.12</a> and <a href="http://www.jyloo.com/news/?pubId=1297423104000">SyntheticaAddons V1.4</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adam Bien</strong> had a very popular blog post about JavaFX 2.0, showing off how you build a very simple <a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/hello_javafx_2_back_to">Hello World application using the early JavaFX 2.0 API</a>. Also interesting is the considerable discussion that took place in the comments section.</li>
	<li><strong>Stephen Chin</strong> was <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/chin-on-javafx-185052.html">interviewed by OTN</a>, where he discusses JavaOne, JavaFX, Visage and other topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Catch you all in a weeks time.</p>
