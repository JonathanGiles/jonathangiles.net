		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Ok, this post is slightly early, but I'm not going to be around much for the next three days, so I thought I'd sneak it out a few hours early rather than make you all wait. Also, because I have very, very little time to write this post, it's going to be a little more succinct than usual. All will return to usual next week, but for now, please enjoy! :-)</p>
<h4>JavaFX</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The big news of the week is that the <a href="http://fxexperience.com/2011/12/its-alive-openjfx-is-kicking-off/">first code drop of JavaFX 2.0 source code was finally made public</a> as <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/openjfx/">OpenJFX</a>. The source code is for the UI controls (which is something I work on). If you are interested in learning more about UI controls, or helping to make them better, you should definitely sign up to the mailing lists.
