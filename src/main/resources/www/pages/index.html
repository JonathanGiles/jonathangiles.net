                        <p>Hi there - I'm Jonathan. I live in semi-rural New Zealand with my family. My career has seen me
                            travel the world and work with many large international software companies. This website lets you
                            learn more about me, what I've done and what I'm currently working on, and how to get in touch!</p>

                        <p>My current role is as a Principal Java Architect at Microsoft, which I've been doing since 2017.
                            Prior to that I was a technical lead in the Java team at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp for nine years.</p>

                        <p>I contribute to open source, most notably <a href="http://openjdk.org">OpenJDK</a> and the
                            <a href="https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-java">Azure SDK for Java</a>. I take immense
                            pride in having my code deployed on almost every computer on the planet. I am passionate about
                            creating excellent developer experiences with
                            <a href="/java-api-design-best-practices.html">considered API design</a>, documentation,
                            testing, and tooling. I have toured the world extensively to
                            <a href="/presentations.html">present</a> and write on these topics, and as a result I am a
                            Java Champion, JavaOne Rockstar, and a Dukeâ€™s Choice award-winner.</p>

                        <p>My professional bio is on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jonathangiles">LinkedIn</a>. I
                            tweet occasionally on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jonathangiles">Twitter</a>. Nearly
                            everything I do is on <a href="https://github.com/JonathanGiles">GitHub</a>. My email is
                            always open at <a href="mailto:jonathan@jonathangiles.net">jonathan@jonathangiles.net</a>.</p>
